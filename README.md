## About this debugging tool
Manage jQuery and jQuery Migrate on a WordPress website, select a specific jQuery and/or jQuery Migrate version. Use this as a debugging tool for your jQuery code.

## Why yet another jQuery Updater / Manager / Developer tool / Debugging tool?
Because none of the developer tools let's you select a specific version of jQuery and/or jQuery Migrate. Providing both the production and the minified version.
This developer tool also let's you turn off jQuery and/or jQuery Migrate.

## I have a few people I need to thank
@YahnisElsts for his amazing work on a updater, we're using in this open source project: https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker
