jQuery Manager for WordPress is a open source project and I would like to invite anyone to contribute. Development and issue tracker is located here on GitHub.

## About this debugging tool
Manage jQuery and jQuery Migrate on a WordPress website, select a specific jQuery and/or jQuery Migrate version. The ultimate jQuery debugging tool for WordPress

## Why yet another jQuery Updater / Manager / Developer / Debugging tool?
Because none of the developer tools let's you select a specific version of jQuery and/or jQuery Migrate. Providing both the production and the minified version.
This developer tool also let's you turn off jQuery and/or jQuery Migrate.

## I have a few people I need to thank
