# jQuery Manager for WordPress
jQuery Manager for WordPress is a open source project and I would like to invite anyone to contribute. Development and issue tracker is located here on GitHub.

## About this debugging tool
Manage jQuery and jQuery Migrate on a WordPress website, select a specific jQuery and/or jQuery Migrate version. The ultimate jQuery debugging tool for WordPress

## Why yet another jQuery Updater / Manager / Developer / Debugging tool?
Because none of the developer tools let's you select a specific version of jQuery and/or jQuery Migrate. Providing both the production and the minified version.
This developer tool also let's you turn on/off jQuery and/or jQuery Migrate.

## Download jQuery Manager for WordPress
Go to the [releases](https://github.com/Remzi1993/wp-jquery-manager/releases) page and download the .zip file.

### Installation via WordPress admin
1. Navigate to > `Plugins` > `Add New`
2. On your top left > click on `Upload Plugin` and select your .zip file you downloaded earlier and click `Install Now`
3. By activating the plugin, jQuery and jQuery Migrate are updated to the latest stable version. (Plugin settings are located under `Tools`)

### Installation via FTP, SFTP or SSH
