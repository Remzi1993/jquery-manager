Manage jQuery and jQuery Migrate on a WordPress website, select a specific jQuery and/or jQuery Migrate version. The ultimate jQuery debugging tool for WordPress

== Description ==
Manage [jQuery](https://jquery.com) and [jQuery Migrate](https://jquery.com/download/#jquery-migrate-plugin) on a WordPress website, select a specific jQuery and/or jQuery Migrate version. The ultimate jQuery debugging tool for WordPress

When activated, the latest stable version of jQuery and jQuery Migrate is added to your website. By default jQuery Migrate uses an uncompressed development build with logging active, so that developers are able to identify deprecated code.

**Warning, this is also a Developer / Debugging tool**

If you are not familiar with beta testing, bug fixing, JavaScript, jQuery and/or running bleeding edge software than I **don't** recommend using this plugin.
I will not provide support on debugging your own JavaScript and/or jQuery code. (Only if you like to hire me, of course)

**Reporting problems**

Report bugs, issues, questions and/or feature request on our [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/Remzi1993/wp-jquery-manager/issues).
I will only provide support on issues caused by this plugin, not your own JavaScript and/or jQuery code. (Again, I will provide paid support or fix all your issues if you're willing to hire me to debug and/or optimize your website)

If you run into any bugs, turning this plugin off (by deactivation the plugin) will fully deactivate everything and return your website to it`s original state.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Is this plugin compatible with PHP 5.6, 7, 7.1, 7.2, HHVM and/or whatever?
1. Short answer: Properly
2. Long answer: I honestly don't know for sure. I didn't used PHP7's new features or something, but I don't know for sure. I made a simple plugin. That's why I recommend a minimum of PHP 5.6

This plugin breaks my site! How do I fix it?
2. Deactivate the plugin and [report](https://github.com/Remzi1993/wp-jquery-manager/issues) this to me, so that I could look into this.

Does this plugin modify my WP installation?
3. **No** modification to the WordPress installation is made, therefore deactivation and/or uninstallation of this plugin returns your site to it`s original state.
