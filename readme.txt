Manage jQuery and jQuery Migrate, activate a specific jQuery and/or jQuery Migrate version. The ultimate jQuery debugging tool for WordPress. This plugin is an open source project, made possible by your contribution (code). Development is done on GitHub.

== Description ==
Manage [jQuery](https://jquery.com) and [jQuery Migrate](https://jquery.com/download/#jquery-migrate-plugin) on a WordPress website, activate a specific jQuery and/or jQuery Migrate version. The ultimate jQuery debugging tool for WordPress

### Features

* Enable / disable remove jQuery Migrate
* Activate / select a specific version of jQuery (Migrate)
* Debug mode for developers

Note that jQuery Manager requires PHP 5.6+ to run.

When the plugin is activated the latest stable version of jQuery and jQuery Migrate are added to your website. The default is sufficient for most people, however the settings provide a way for you to tweak your jQuery install.

jQuery Manager for WordPress is an open source project and I would like to invite anyone to contribute. The development and issue tracker is located on GitHub, see: [github.com/Remzi1993/jquery-manager](https://github.com/Remzi1993/jquery-manager)

**This is also a Developer / Debugging tool**

Everything should work as intended, you should check your website if everything works fine. If things don't work, don't panic. You can deactivate the plugin and return to the state before or tweak it's settings until everything works as intended.

You should understand that not all themes and/or plugins support the latest jQuery version even with jQuery Migrate turned on, but for you to encounter this is highly unlikely if your theme or plugins are up to date.
This is also a developer/debugging tool.

I will not provide support on debugging your own JavaScript and/or jQuery code. (Only if you like to hire me, of course)

**Reporting problems**

Report bugs, issues, questions and/or feature request on our [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/Remzi1993/jquery-manager/issues).

I will only provide support on issues caused by this plugin, not your own JavaScript and/or jQuery code. (Again, I will provide paid support or fix all your issues if you're willing to hire me to debug and/or optimize your website)

If you run into any bugs, turning this plugin off (by deactivation the plugin) will fully deactivate everything and return your website to it`s original state.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin compatible with PHP 5.6, 7, 7.1, 7.2, HHVM, et cetera, et cetera? =
Short answer: probably. Long answer: I honestly don't know for sure. As far as I know I didn't use specific PHP 7 features. I made a simple plugin. That's why I recommend a minimum of PHP 5.6. Also I do specific tests to ensure that I stay compatible with PHP 5.6

= This plugin breaks my site! How do I fix it? =
Deactivate the plugin and report this on the [plugin support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/jquery-manager/) or report it on the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/Remzi1993/jquery-manager/issues), so that I could take a look into the matter.

= Does this plugin modify my WP installation? =
**No** modification to the WordPress installation is made, therefore deactivation and/or uninstallation of this plugin returns your site to it`s original state.

= Which jQuery (Migrate) version do you support? =
This plugin supports the 3 jQuery branches/versions and 2 versions of jQuery Migrate. You're able to select/activate a specific version or to disable it/turn it off completely<br>

There are two versions of jQuery Migrate. jQuery Migrate 1.x will help you update your pre-1.9 jQuery code to jQuery 1.9 up to 3.0.

jQuery Migrate 3.x helps you update code to run on jQuery 3.0 or higher. Most websites need jQuery Migrate 3.x, but if you have a modern/well supported WP theme and/or plugin(s) than you could give it a try to disable it. Check your browser dev tools if you see any errors.

**jQuery versions**
jQuery 3.x (default is compressed/minified production)
jQuery 2.x
jQuery 1.x

**jQuery Migrate versions**
jQuery Migrate 3.x (default is compressed/minified production)
jQuery Migrate 1.x

= Is it possible to disable jQuery Migrate? =
Yes, this is possible and done in the plugin settings.

= Is it possible to enable a specific version of jQuery (Migrate) =
Yes, this is possible and done in the plugin settings.

= What is jQuery Migrate? =
The jQuery Migrate plugin was created to simplify the transition from older versions of jQuery. The plugin restores deprecated features and behaviors so that older code will still run properly on newer versions of jQuery.

Use the uncompressed development version to diagnose compatibility issues, it will generate warnings on the console that you can use to identify and fix problems. Use the compressed production version to simply fix compatibility issues without generating console warnings.

There are two versions of jQuery Migrate. jQuery Migrate 1.x will help you update your pre-1.9 jQuery code to jQuery 1.9 up to 3.0.

jQuery Migrate 3.x helps you update code to run on jQuery 3.0 or higher.
