This plugin updates jQuery and jQuery Migrate to the latest stable version on your website.

== Description ==
This plugin updates [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) to the latest official stable version, which is most likely not available within the latest stable release of WordPress.
[jQuery Migrate](http://jquery.com/download/#jquery-migrate-plugin) is also included with logging active, so that developers are able to identify deprecated code.

**No** modification to the WordPress installation is made, therefore deactivation and/or uninstallation of this plugin returns your site to it`s original state.

**Warning**

If you are not familiar with beta testing, bug fixing, JavaScript, jQuery or running bleeding edge software it`s **not** recommended.
I will not provide support on debugging your JavaScript and/or jQuery code. (Only if you like to hire me, of course)

**Reporting problems**

Please post bug reports and request for support on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/Remzi1993/wp-jquery-updater/issues). I will only provide support on issues caused by this plugin, not your own JavaScript and/or jQuery code.

If you run into any bugs, turning this plugin off will fully deactivate everything.
