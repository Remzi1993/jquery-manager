## Reporting a vulnerability

Due to different time zones (I live in Europe/Amsterdam) it may take me longer to reply. Please, bear this in mind.

You can mail me at: ict@remzi.info (in private for serious security issues) or create an issue on the GitHub project page at https://github.com/Remzi1993/jquery-manager/issues.

I will reply/respond within 24 / 48 hours. Please, give me time to fix this in a timely manner.
